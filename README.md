# Music genre classifier

## Task
Classifier build using statistical learning techniques to classify the genre of songs; the idea behind the solution I implemented is to use short time Fourier transform coefficients to obtain from them some features useful for both supervised learning (classification) and unsupervised learning  (clustering) tasks.

## Data
The dataset consist in 150 songs with their labels:

- Metal
- Rock
- Hip hop
- Reggae
- Country


The project is developed in R.
